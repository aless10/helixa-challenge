## Helixa Challenge

The project concerns the creation of an REST API for finding items within a tree. Starting from 2 JSON structured at several levels, the API must allow to search in each of them (separately) the last level elements that contain a given string in 2 modes:

Search for the leaves on the whole tree
Search for leaves on a specific sublayer (passed in input to the API)
 
A plus is the realization of automatic tests.

Attached are the 2 JSON files:
* categories.json
* psyhographics.json

### Categories.json 
The search must be done for the name field. The children are identified by the children field.
### Psychographics.json
The research must be done for the label field. The children are identified by the values ​​field.

## How to run the application
